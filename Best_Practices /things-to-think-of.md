Things to think of before you get started... 
    - who will be completing the tests?
    - How do I need to write the tests to ensure they cover everything they need 
    - Spell it out for any UAT (you created but the user did not)
    - Dont do shortcuts... type it out (i know it sucks but just do it)
    - Walk away for a bit and then come back to make sure you got it all
    - Be sure that everything is the correct test (all titles are the same and that everthing is numbered as well)
    - 

    /// <reference types="Cypress" />

    `source /Users/cmedders/.rvm/scripts/rvm` - To start using RVM you need to run `source /Users/cmedders/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
    in all your open shell windows, in rare cases you need to reopen all shell windows.
