Things to think of before you get started... 
    - who will be completing the tests?
    - How do I need to write the tests to ensure they cover everything they need 
    - Spell it out for any UAT (you created but the user did not)
    - Dont do shortcuts... type it out (i know it sucks but just do it)
    - Walk away for a bit and then come back to make sure you got it all
    - Be sure that everything is the correct test (all titles are the same and that everthing is numbered as well)
