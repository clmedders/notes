Things to think of before you get started... 
    # who will be completing the tests?
    # How do I need to write the tests to ensure they cover everything they need 
    # Spell it out for any UAT (you created but the user did not)
    # Dont do shortcuts... type it out (i know it sucks but just do it)
    # Walk away for a bit and then come back to make sure you got it all
