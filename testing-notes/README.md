Different types of Testing’s and when they are needed?



1. Regression testing

Regression testing is the process of testing changes to Applications to make sure that the existing application still works with the new changes.
Automation testing majorly does Regression testing
Recommended before every release
Effective Regression Tests can be done by selecting the following test cases –
Test cases which have frequent defects
Functionalities Critical
Integration Test Cases





2. Smoke tests

Smoke test development and regression test development are related and similar,

The only difference is in depth scope and duration of running the tests

Typically Runs after every build

Add the most critical tests to the smoke test suite

Automate smoke testing in your CD environment











3. Component Testing

Component testing is a method where testing of each component in an application is done separately.

Component testing may be done in isolation from rest of the system depending on the development life cycle model chosen for that particular application.

Difference between Component Test and Unit Test



4. What is Integration Testing?

Integration Testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group.



5. System/EndtoEnd Testing:

SYSTEM TESTING is a level of software testing where a complete and integrated software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the specified requirements



6. Exploratory Testing :

Exploratory testing is an unscripted QA testing technique used to discover unknown issues during and after the software development process

Automation testing has few limits and this exploratory testing is essential to deliver product with bug free confidence

Difference Between Verification and Validation :
Verification :The process of evaluating work-products (not the actual final product) of a development phase to determine whether they meet the specified requirements for that phase..
Validation : The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified business requirements.
UAT Testing: This is typically the last step before the product goes live or before the delivery of the product is accepted. UAT is after the product itself is thoroughly tested

Load Testing : Load Testing help us to study the behavior of the application under various loads. The main parameter to focus is response time. This study reveals how many concurrent users that server can handle effectively and quickly.
Stress Testing : Stress Testing help us to observe the stability of the application. The main intention is to identify the breaking point of the server
